# Chrome-Password-Generator
A simple Chrome plugin that generates random passwords. It uses the dinopass API (dinopass.com) to generate pronounceable passwords. Available on the chrome web store.
This is cloned and adapted from : https://github.com/domkirby/Chrome-Password-Generator
Domkirby's original extension gave the ability to grab a password from DinoPass or to generate a random password of a selected length, this version simply gives the DinoPass passwords

But it also gives the option to display the password in 'NATO Phonetic's to help avoid confusion between Characters/Numbers and Symbols.

The extension stores the last generated password in chrome.storage.local to allow copy/pasting of both the password and the phonetic output.

PLEASE REMEMBER TO CLEAR THE STORAGE USING THE 'Clear Password' BUTTON or else anyone using your chrome can read the last password!!!

Main aim for admins, generate password, paste into aproprate field in admin page (say update password for email) and then copy/paste the phonetics to give to end user.
